This MERN web app has 3 tiers:

1 database management: CRUD operations using Mongo.
2 report generation: generate pdf for current/all proyectores with scanneable barcode for inventory purpouses
3 user operation: 1 selector of all projectors, once selected the user only can power on/off and select input.
